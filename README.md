From the [Redump.org wiki](http://wiki.redump.org/index.php?title=Redump.org):

> [Redump.org](http://redump.org/) is a disc preservation database and internet community dedicated to collecting precise and accurate information about every video game ever released on optical media of any system. The goal is to make blueprints of the data on console and computer game discs. Multiple dumps of games with the same serial number by different people are collected to ensure the same results are gathered, which help correct any incorrect dumps in the database as well as to help recognize alternate versions of the same game.

This repository serves as an archive of the data I have personally dumped and submitted to Redump.org. This provides both an accurate reference for myself should this data ever need to be re-submitted as well as a convienent place to share scans that the Redump staff use in their validation process.

Note that just like Redump.org itself, this repository does ***NOT*** contain any game files. I neither support nor condone software piracy or illegal distribution of copyrighted material. Scans of copyrighted content stored here are for documentation and preservation purposes only.
